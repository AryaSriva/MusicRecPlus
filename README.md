As part of our CS115 class, we were to create a project in python that would take in user inputs for artists and give users recommendations based on their similarity with other users who share similar inputted artists as well as other functionality, such as calculating the most popular artist and how popular the most popular artist is. The program will also store and print users and their artist lists to a text file.
